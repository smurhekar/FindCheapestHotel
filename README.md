Find cheapest hotel

A hotel chain wishes to create an online portal where users/customer can find cheapest hotel based on certain criteria. For now, they wish to start with three hotels which are Miami Beach, Miami Downtown, Miami Midtown. 

Story1
Each hotel has fixed rate per day.
Miami Beach has rate of 80$.
Miami Downtown has rate of 120$.
Miami Midtown has rate of 100$.

Can you help the hotel by writing a program to find the cheapest hotel?
